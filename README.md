## Project:
That's a classic to-do list app, that allows us to set a list of tasks to follow-up. <br>
The application has the option to add new tasks, mark it as completed, edit your task's name and remove a task from the list.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.<br>

## Next steps:
> I have planned to implement in this application improvements related to accessibility, as it is very important that it can be played properly by everyone! <br><br>
> It's missing the favicon image. <br><br>
> Add a toolbar where the user will be able to search for specific tasks on the list and filter by done or to-do tasks.<br><br>
> Use local storage to save the tasks to the next time the user opens the application.
